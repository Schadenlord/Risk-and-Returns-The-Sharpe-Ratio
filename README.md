# Use pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.

Project Introduction

When you evaluate whether to invest in an asset, you are not only looking at how much money you can make, but also how much risk you are taking. The Sharpe Ratio, proposed by Nobel laureate William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does just that: it compares the return on an investment to that of alternative options and relates the return to the risk of the investment, measured in standard deviation measurement returns.

In this project, you will use pandas to apply Sharpe ratios to real financial data. Before starting this project, you should have completed the DataCamp course Importing and Managing Financial Data Using Python.
